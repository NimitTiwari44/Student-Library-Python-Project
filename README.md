# Student-Library-Python-Project
<br>
# Introduction
<br>
The project is a simple library management system implemented in Python. It allows a library to manage its collection of books and lets students borrow and return books. The system consists of two main classes: Library and Student.
<br>
# Key Points to Highlight
<br>
1. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts by using classes and methods to encapsulate the library's functionality and the student's interactions.
<br>
2. Proper user prompts and input handling ensure a smooth interaction flow
